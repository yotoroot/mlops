## MLOps with Kubeflow

### What is MLOps?

MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices that aim to bridge the gap between data science and software engineering. It combines principles from DevOps, software engineering, and machine learning to create a more efficient and reliable process for developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models.

### Why is MLOps important?

As machine learning models become more complex and widely used, it becomes increasingly important to have a robust process for managing their lifecycle. MLOps can help to:

Improve the quality and reliability of machine learning models
Increase the speed of model development and deployment
Reduce the risk of model failure in production
Make it easier to collaborate between data scientists and engineers
What are the key components of MLOps?

MLOps encompasses a wide range of activities, but some of the key components include:

Model versioning
Model testing and validation
Model deployment and monitoring
Infrastructure automation
Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)

### Tools and Frameworks 

There are a number of different tools and frameworks available to help you get started with MLOps. Some of the popular ones include:

Kubeflow - this is what we going to be focus on
MLflow
Seldon
Amazon SageMaker
Google Cloud AI Platform
